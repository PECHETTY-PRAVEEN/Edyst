"""
In Fibonacci series, the next number is the sum of previous two numbers. The series starts with 0 and 1, and then the next numbers are a sum of the previous 2 numbers.

For example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc.

Here the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1

The next numbers are:

1 (= 1 + 0)
2 (= 1 + 1)
3 (= 2 + 1)
5 (= 3 + 2)
And so onâ€¦

Write a method Met that prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci series. The value of n is passed as an integer parameter to the method.

The Met method has to be inside a Solution class. Please check the code editor for the ideal method definition.

Hint: You already know the first 2 values. How can you calculate the remaining?

Print the values on a single line, separated by a space character. At the end of the line, print a new line.

Example Input: 1
Output: 0
Example Input: 0
Output:
Example Input: 6
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5
Example Input: 3
Output: 0 1 1
Example Input: 2
Output: 0 1
